        Making lasagna can be time-consuming, but the results are well worth the wait. You'll find a detailed ingredient
        list and step-by-step instructions in the recipe below
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
        <li>1 (32 ounce) jar spaghetti sauce</li>
        <li>32 ounces cottage cheese</li>
        <li>3 cups shredded mozzarella cheese, divided</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>½ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons dried parsley</li>
        <li> salt to taste</li>
        <li> ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>9 lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>½ cup water</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>

            To make the meat sauce, heat 2 tbsp olive oil in a frying pan and cook 750g lean beef mince in two batches
            for about 10 mins until browned all over.
        </li>
        <li>

            Finely chop 4 slices of prosciutto from a 90g pack, then stir through the meat mixture.
        </li>
        <li>


            Pour over 800g passata or half our basic tomato sauce recipe and 200ml hot beef stock. Add a little grated
            nutmeg, then season.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bring up to the boil, then simmer for 30 mins until the sauce looks rich.
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4 and lightly oil an ovenproof dish (about 30 x 20cm).
        </li>
        <li>
            Spoon one third of the meat sauce into the dish, then cover with some fresh lasagne sheets from a 300g pack.
            Drizzle over roughly 130g ready-made or homemade white sauce.
        </li>
        <li>
            Repeat until you have three layers of pasta. Cover with the remaining 390g white sauce, making sure you
            can’t see any pasta poking through.
        </li>
        <li>
            Scatter 125g torn mozzarella over the top.
        </li>
        <li>

            Arrange the rest of the prosciutto on top. Bake for 45 mins until the top is bubbling and lightly browned.
        </li>
    </ol>
